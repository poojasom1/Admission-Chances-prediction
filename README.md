# Admission-Chances-prediction
Creating Machine learning models to predict the ‘Chance of Admit’ with minimum Mean Squared error and Root Mean Squared Error
and maximum R-Square score.
Building following models 
1. Multiple linear regressor (MLR)
2. Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
3. MLR with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. RFR with PCA
Ploting the actual and predicting values for all the four models and ploting the most
significant features (output of PCA) against the output y_pred.
